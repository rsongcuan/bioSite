                Jake Erichsen is a Team Leader at the company Thrasher Foundation Repair. Growing up Jake was a very
                active guy, into sports and physical type of work. He played college baseball at Briar Cliff University
                in his hometown of Sioux City, IA, and didn’t know what he wanted to do after that, just that he couldn’t
                stand the idea of working a desk job. Through connections of his now-wife Ashley, Jake was given an opportunity
                to interview at Thrasher, and he hasn’t looked back since.

                As a foundation repair company, Thrasher covers a wide range of home improvement projects, ranging from
                sinking foundation to waterproofing to installation of egress windows. Jake’s worked his way from an
                entry-level installer through five different promotions to become a Team Leader in six years time.
                He’s one of the youngest people in his position at his company, and holds a lot of respect from the
                crews he leads. He’s in charge of seeing a job through from start to finish, including helping with the
                work itself, delegating tasks, securing materials for each job, maintaining timesheets, and more.
                His territory covers all of Nebraska and most of its bordering states, which means he can spend a lot of
                time on the road, but loves the opportunity to work close to home. He has aspirations to continue his
                growth into Thrasher’s partner company, SupportWorks, and share his knowledge by training teams across
                the country.

                All of his hard work has led him to be the company’s top Team Leader, as his crews installed $1.6 million
                worth of work in 2021, which is the highest the company’s history, surpassing his own 2020 record.
                He was recognized through his acceptance into Thrasher’s leadership program where he went through
                training sessions put on by the company’s executives.
